The Organ Donation (OrgDon) system is developed to create a digital platform that connects organ donors, recipients, and healthcare institutions in an efficient and transparent manner. The project addresses the challenges of unorganized donor data, lack of accessibility, and delays in communication by integrating a centralized database and user-friendly Android application. Users can register as organ donors, manage their profiles, and view available hospitals and donation details, while recipients and healthcare professionals can search and match donors based on organ type and blood group. The application also incorporates Firebase Authentication for secure login and signup, ensuring data privacy and authorized access. By providing real-time information, seamless navigation, and easy registration, the system enhances awareness of organ donation, improves coordination between stakeholders, and contributes toward saving lives through faster organ allocation.
